Using the browser's geolocation functionality, the user's coordinates are POSTed to the server, which then queries the database for all landmarks with coordinates within five miles of the user's location. These are then identified as markers on the front-end map. Users can likewise add landmarks with their current location being autofilled in the lat and long fields in the submit form.

## How to Run
